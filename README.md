SITE Pre-Work Submission
Name: [Aisha Chowdhury]

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. [google.com, https://tenor.com/,https://www.w3schools.com/]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) [One challenge I faced was to adjust the margin to get all the elements of the page in the center. I solved this issue by searching it on google and looking at the W3Schools website.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) [What are the skills I need to become a full-stack developer? How to make a good full-stack developer portfolio?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) [If I had more time, I would like to work recording and displaying players' scores, limit the time, and levels on the screen. I would also give strikes before the player loses the game and change the sounds.]
